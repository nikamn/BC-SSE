MaxNodes -  the maximum number of nodes

Theta -  number of nodes (< MaxNodes)

polyOrder (degree of polynomial) = Theta

Polynomial will act as a secret key

Owner calculates polynomial at (N = MaxNodes) differnt points
These will act as secret shares

Client chooses any (n = Theta) secret shares out of (N = MaxNodes) secret shares

Client reconstructs the polynomial
